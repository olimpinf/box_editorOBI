To generate a CMS contest from box files you need to provide some
extra files:

1) In the "attic" directory of each problem, create a file called
"cms.txt" containing the title for the problem (string, utf-8),
limit (in MB) and public testcases (string).

Example:
------------------------
title = "Conto de Fadas"
memory_limit = 1024
time_limit = 2
public_testcases = "0, 1, 2, 3"
------------------------

Notes:
  * If memory_limit is not given, the default is 1024
  * if public_testcases is not given, the default is all tests from first
     group; use "all" to  make all testcases public
  * Other variables that can be set in the CMS file "task.yaml" can also
    be defined, and will be copied to the task file "task.yams".

2) In the "cms" directory create a file "users.csv" with the users of the contest
in the CSV format. The file must contain at least the fields

   user_id,password,ip.

Fields first_name and last_name are optional.

Example:
------------------------
user_id,password,ip,first_name,last_name
012345-0,p1,null,João Luís,Santos
------------------------

Notes:
   * If the password starts with "pbkdf2" it is assumed it is a hashed password
     using the pbkdf2 algorithm (used in the OBI site).

3) In the "cms" directory, create a file "contest.txt" describing the contest. An
example of its contents is given below:

------------------------
####################################
# configuration file for the contest
####################################

# short name of the contest -- cannot contain spaces!
name = "prova"

# description, to be displayed in the contest page header
description = "Uma Prova"

# contest date and time
start = "2021-03-10 07:00:00 -03:00"
stop = "2021-03-30 07:00:00 -03:00"

# per_user_time -- if set, contestants can start any time
# and use this amount of time (in seconds)
# for example, for 2 hours, set it to 60*60*2
per_user_time = 60*60*5

# tokens
token_mode =  "disabled"

# submissions
min_submission_interval = 60
max_submission_number = 100
min_user_test_interval = 60
max_user_test_number = 50
------------------------

Notes:
   * Any other variable that can be defined in the CMS file "contest.yaml" can be
     set, and will be copied to the contest file "contest.yaml".

Then, to produce the CMS package:

* run "box check" in the "problems" directory (or run "box check" for each problem)
* cd to the "cms" directory
* run "../../bin/build_cms.py -u users.csv contest.txt

A new directory with the CMS package will be created.
